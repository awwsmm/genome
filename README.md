# The Programming Language Genome Project<a name="footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>

The Programming Language Genome Project (PLGP) is an attempt to trace the introduction, development, and evolution of programming language features (syntax and concepts) throughout history.

## Goals

The explicit goals of the project are as follows

1. To determine when and in which language(s) particular programming language features first appeared
    
2. To determine when and how these features
    - evolved over time within their originator language(s)
    - were adopted and evolved over time in other languages

Point #1 addresses the question of _origin_, while point #2 addresses the question of _evolution_. The ultimate primary goal of the project is to develop a robust "evolutionary tree" of programming languages. All sources should be cited and should be primary sources whenever possible.

## Motivation

Why undertake such a large project? The hope is that, using the evolutionary tree described above, we'll be able to...

1. ...quantitatively determine
    - which languages are more or less closely related (by shared features)
    - which earlier languages had greater or lesser influence on latter ones (by shared features)
    - which feature(s) provide the greatest "evolutionary advantage"
        - ...which are adopted by the largest number of languages, and
        - ...which have the greatest longevity

2. ...make observations about
    - convergent evolution (two "unrelated" programming languages converging on the same concepts / syntax)
    - the "Darwinism" of concepts and syntax -- which ones "win" by becoming more widely adopted
    - "missing" features of programming languages, determined by "gaps" in the evolutionary tree
    - "eras" in programming, when certain features were popular or rapidly appeared in several languages

## Contributing

We welcome contributors and will soon have make some contribution guidelines available.
